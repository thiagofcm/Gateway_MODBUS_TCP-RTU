# Gateway_MODBUS_TCP-RTU
Gateway Modbus TCP/RTU Firmware

This project aimed to develop a Modbus Gateway, serving as a cost-effective solution for bridging older and newer industrial equipment. This not only prolonged the operational life of legacy devices but also enriched the capabilities of conventional industrial networks. More precisely, our aim was to facilitate the connection between Programable Logic Controllers (PLC's) utilizing Modbus TCP and those employing Modbus RTU, a task uniquely accomplished by a Gateway. As result, we conducted successful tests and deployed the device in practical applications, seamlessly integrating it with industrial equipment at the Industrial Network Lab of the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia and a supervisory system. 

This repository was created upon the completion of the research on the 'DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMMUNICATOR GATEWAY BETWEEN MODBUS TCP/RTU PROTOCOLS' under the guidance of Professor Dr. Renato Ferreira Fernandes. It contains the firmware code, images of the environment in which we worked, references used, as well as the resulting publications.

At the end of this project, the gateway developed was used as a methodological tool for educational purposes for the subject of Industrial Networks, given by Professor Renato Ferreira Fernandes.
